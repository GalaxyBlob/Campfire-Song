Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say
"Did you ever see a goose
Kissing a moose?"
Down by the bay.

...My mother will say
"Did you ever see a whale
With a polka dot tail?"
Down by the bay.

...My mother will say
"Did you ever see a fly
Wearing a tie?
Down by the bay.

...My mother will say
"Did you ever see a fish
eating off a dish?"
Down by the bay.

...My mother will say
"Did you ever see a shark
wearing a scarf?"
Down by the bay.

...My mother will say
"Did you ever see a cow
ready to go down?"
Down by the bay.
